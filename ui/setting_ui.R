It performs threshold-free Bayesian differential analysis and generates quantitative concordance and discordance scores (c-scores and d-scores) both genome-wide and at pathway level for all pair-wise studies. Based on the c-scores/d-scores, CAMO conducts a series of downstream machine learning and bioinformatics analysis with interactive visualization for pathway knowledge retrieval and topological gene module detection. Outputs from the tool will provide the foundations for hypothesis generation and subsequent translational investigations."),
