# CAMO
CAMO is an analytical software with R Shiny based graphical user interface (GUI) for evaluating omics congruence of model organisms. It performs threshold-free Bayesian differential analysis and generates quantitative concordance and discordance scores (c-scores and d-scores) both genome-wide and at pathway level for all pair-wise studies. Based on the c-scores/d-scores, CAMO conducts a series of downstream machine learning and bioinformatics analysis with interactive visualization for pathway knowledge retrieval and topological gene module detection.

## How to run from docker image
```
docker pull weiiizong/camo
docker run --rm --name camo -p 3838:3838 weiiizong/camo:1.0
```

Then goto your web browser on [http://127.0.0.1:3838/CAMO/](http://127.0.0.1:3838/CAMO/).

Do note that docker is a container application that will refresh everytime you restart the application. So expert knowledge is required to mount internal data directory out in order to persist work progress. Results generated during the computation are saved temporarily at /srv/shiny-server/CAMO/results. One way to copy results from the file system of a container with ID "#containerID" to the local machine is to run 
```
docker cp #containerID:/srv/shiny-server/CAMO/results .
```
If you just want to try out CAMO, docker is a great place to start. If you really use this software in your daily work, it is recommended that you read more detailed instruction on our docker page.

For more information, refer to [docker page](https://hub.docker.com/r/weiiizong/camo).

## How to start the app

#### Requirement
* R >= 4.0.0
* Rcpp >= 1.0.0
* Shiny >= 1.0.0

MacOS users may need to install xcode first. Run the following code in terminal to install:
```
xcode-select --install
```
MacOS users may encounter error ``*** C++11 compiler required; enable C++11 mode in your compiler, or use an earlier version of Armadillo", which can be solved by run following code command in R Console:
```
Sys.setenv("PKG\_CXXFLAGS"="-std=c++11")
```

#### Install the Shiny software
1. Install the CAMO R package and dependency packages following the instruction at [https://github.com/CAMO-R/Rpackage](https://github.com/CAMO-R/Rpackage).
2. Download the CAMO Shiny project at [https://github.com/CAMO-R/Rshiny](https://github.com/CAMO-R/Rshiny) by clicking on "code > Download ZIP" and extract to a local folder renamed as "Rshiny".

#### Start the Shiny software
1. Open "RunShiny.R" file in R console.
2. Set the working directory of R to the directory "path\_to\_Rshiny/" which contains the Shiny project folder "Rshiny" saved above.
3. Click on the "Run App" button.
Note that the installation progress of R packages may take up to a few minutes. Please check the progress in R console and may need to select whether to update all/some/none packages. After all packages has been installed, the CAMO Shiny app will automatically open in your default browser.

## Where to find the full tutorial 
After starting CAMO, users need to select a local directory as the working directory in the Setting page before any analysis. Please refer to the full tutorial for details at
